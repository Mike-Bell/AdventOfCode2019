Advent of code 2019

Folders are organized by day

Within each day is a bundle of scripts / node modules. You'll wanna start by running `npm install` in a given day's folder. You can then run any unit tests I've written for that day's challenge with `npm run test` (this will run jest tests). If a given day has multiple "parts", you can run the solutions for separate parts by doing `npm run 1`, `npm run 2`, etc. You can see the available commands for a given day in that day's `package.json` scripts section.
